Using this app, people can book a cab from one location to another location. Being a cab booking app company, exploiting the understanding of cab supply and demand could increase the efficiency of their service and enhance user experience by minimizing waiting time.\n","Objective of this project is to combine historical usage pattern along with the open data sources like weather data to forecast cab booking demand in a city"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ADAngxvjerXz"},"source":["### Data\n","You will be provided with hourly renting data span of two years. Data is randomly divided into train and test set. You must predict the total count of cabs booked in each hour covered by the test set, using the information available prior to the booking period.
